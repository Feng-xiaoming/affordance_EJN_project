# affordance_EJN_project
# For the sake of open science, we shared our data analysis codes from EEG data-importing, preprocessing, epoching, to ERPs calculation codes, and also SAM calculation codes and some useful data visualization codes.
# Regarding data importing and preprocessing, EEG epoching, ERPs calculation and SAM items calculation, we saved codes via seperate folders. Regarding data visualization codes, we shared python codes via a text doc file.   
# Hopefully, this codes sharing can be supportive for the related academic community.
