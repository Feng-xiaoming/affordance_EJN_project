# affordance_EJN_project
# For the sake of open science, we shared our data analysis codes from EEG data-importing, preprocessing, epoching, to ERPs calculation codes, and also SAM calculation codes and some useful data visualization codes.
# Regarding data importing and preprocessing, EEG epoching, ERPs calculation and SAM items calculation, we saved codes via seperate folders. Regarding data visualization codes, we shared python codes via a text doc file.   
# Hopefully, this codes sharing can be supportive for the related academic community. 
# Regarding the original preprocessing codes, you can search it by this link: https://github.com/BeMoBIL/bemobil-pipeline. In order to use it, I recommend you read all original codes and README files first.
